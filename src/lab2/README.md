### 1. Introduction

This lab focuses on implementing a decision model for some given constraints via _linear programming_. You could use the following python packages to solve _linear programs_:

- [x] [Linear Programming with Python and PuLP](http://benalexkeen.com/linear-programming-with-python-and-pulp/)
- [x] [scipy.optimize.linprog](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html)

> For more details: checkout this [detailed guidline](https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/#linear-programming-python-implementation)

You can check a detailed work through of this lab [here](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/DeM-Lab/blob/main/docs/binary_relationships_via_linear_programming.md)

#### 3.1. Create new enviornment

Before starting, you may have to create new enviornment for the lab. Kindly, checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/DeM-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_ENV.md) for creating an new environment.

#

Once, you have activated your new enviornment, we will install all the dependencies of this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3.2. Setup `pre-commit` hooks

In order to setup `pre-commit` hooks, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/DeM-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_PRE-COMMIT_HOOKS.md).
