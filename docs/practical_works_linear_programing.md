### Use case - Miracle Worker

Letâ€™s try to formalize an use-case and carry it forward throughout the article. Suppose you are a magical healer and you goal is to
heal anyone who asks for help. The more you are able to heal someone, the better. Your secret behind the healing is 2 medicines, each of
which uses special herbs. To create one unit of medicine 1, you need 3 units of herb A and 2 units of herb B. Similarly, to create one unit
of medicine 2, you need 4 and 1 units of herb A and B respectively. Now medicine 1 can heal a person by 25 unit of health (whatever it
is) and medicine 2 by 20 units. To complicate things further, you only have 25 and 10 units of herb A and B at your disposal. Now the
question is, how many of each medicine will you create to maximize the health of the next person who walks in ?
